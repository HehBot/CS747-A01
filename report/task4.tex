\section*{Task 4}

On every reward we are told which set of arms was pulled. Thus our beliefs for expected reward for both sets of arms will be independent and can be estimated via Thompson sampling.


Thus
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{a_t = \argmax_a \left(\dfrac{x_t^{a,1} + x_t^{a,2}}{2}\right)}
\end{align*}
where $\boxed{x_t^{a,i}\text{ is sampled from }\mathcal{B}(s_t^{a,i} + 1, f_t^{a,i} + 1)}$, the beta distribution for arm $a$ of set $i$.
